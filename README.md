This repository hosts the behind the scenes code for my personal portfolio site. I've open sourced it for a few reasons:

- So if there are errors, people can send in issues or pull requests and get in the habit of doing so. This behavior makes the world a better place and I want to support it.
- So others can fork it and use it as a base for their sites, or for learning node.js, or the GitHub+Jitsu+TravisCI deployment workflow.
- So potential employers can have a look at how I build things, even if it is casual. A commit log is valuable in my mind just as much as a portfolio site. This solves both.

## Licensing
I'm not sure what to do about licensing, so I'll have to look it up. I believe the standard open source license is MIT? The only things that I cannot provision use or license for at other people's plugins and work that I have included in this project - some of which I paid for. So as long as you respect that portion, we're good.

I hope you enjoy it as I am quite proud. Feel free to send in bugs / issues / pull requests - I would love to keep getting better!
