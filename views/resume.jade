				p Hello, I am a full stack web application developer and product manager. In my experience, not everyone at a company speaks everyone else's language. I aim to keep communication effective, and make sure every member of the project team(s) &#151; clients included &#151; are all able to communicate with each other and produce optimal solutions. I understand the aspects of web applications & product solutions from front to back, and how to effectively communicate to and contribute with team members at each position along the way.
